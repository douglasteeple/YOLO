# Darknet: Open Source Neural Networks in C

Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation. It was written by Joseph Chet Redmon, and I cloned his project and am making updates to it. THank you Jospeh!

It is very fast, very easy to install, written in C, so very portable. I run on MacOSX.
