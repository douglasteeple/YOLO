# Darknet: Open Source Neural Networks in C

Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation. It was written by Joseph Chet Redmon, and I cloned his project and am making updates to it. Thank you Jospeh!

It is very fast, very easy to install, written in C, so very portable. I run on MacOSX. It runs forwards and backwards, processing and annotating images very quickly - especially on a multi-GPU machine.

For more information see the [Darknet project website](http://pjreddie.com/darknet).

# YOLO

You Only Look Once...Y ou only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Titan X it processes images at 40-90 FPS and has a mAP on VOC 2007 of 78.6% and a mAP of 48.1% on COCO test-dev.
